# Zuzanna's BMI Challenge
## at CraftAcademy bootcamp week 2

**Assignment**

The challenge is to build a JavaScript-based program that calculates the BMI (body mass index) based on a person's weight and height.
This program is built according to the BDD (Behavior Driven Development), with help of testing tool Jasmine.

**Building instructions**

1. Download Jasmine runner
2. Create a project folder for the BMI Challenge and extract the content of the jasmine-standalone.zip package to that folder
3. From your terminal ```open SpecRunner.html``` to test the tool
4. Remember that whatever files you create (both specs and source files) they MUST be included in the SpecRunner.html!

**How to run the application**

1. From your terminal ```open index.html```
2. Choose:
* Metric as the calculation method - enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters
* or switch to the Imperial method - put your weight in pounds and height in inches
3. Get the result (BMI index and BMI status) by clicking the Calculate button
